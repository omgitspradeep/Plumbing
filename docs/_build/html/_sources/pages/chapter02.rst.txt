Stocks and dies, up to 2” diameter, replacement of cutters 
==========================================================

To connect two or more pipes while plumbing we need to create threading in pipes so that they connect as a single pipeline. For that we need die stock and dies.

A diestock is an equipment which helps us to create uniform threads on different types of screws, bolts and pipes. It is a framework as shown in figure that provides space to insert cutting tools called dies. Also, it helps to makes sure the amount of pressure applied throughout the thread cutting process remain uniform.

Caulking iron
=============

Caulking iron or making iron are used for packing or putting the Cotton or Oakum into the seam between the planks especially in ship building and in leaded cast iron pipe joints. In pipe joints oakum (a rope like substance made from jute, tar and Bentonite clay) is packed into the joints using a yarning iron. Oakum swells when its moist and makes a tight joint. Melted lead is poured into the joint covering the oakum and when lead cools down we tighten the lead using caulking iron. Caulking irons are used to hammer the lead into the recessed end of the pipe joint which makes a sturdy permanent seal.

Pipe cutter-use and care adjustment of cutting wheels 
=====================================================

It has always been acknowledged that the best way to cut pipe is  by using pipe cutter because this method assures the pipe is cut squarely, accurately and quickly. Pipe cutter are available in different sizes. Use depends on pipe size, material and situations. Figure shows the pipe cutter when its components are separated and combined.

.. figure:: images/2-12a.png
    :alt: Image showing Pipe cutter
    

.. figure:: images/2-12b.png
    :alt: Image showing Pipe cutter's parts
    
    Figure 2-13 Pipe cutter

1) Select the Correct cutter
----------------------------

    To get maximum performance from a tool, one should always ensure that the correct model of pipe cutter has been selected for the job else it may result in serious injury and damage to the tool and workpiece.




2) Adjustment of cutting wheel
------------------------------

    Always ensure that when selecting the cutter, the cutting wheel is of the type suited to – the cutter being used and the material to be cut. 
    
    Always inspect the cutter wheel before being used to see that it is not blunt or damaged in any way.

    .. figure:: images/2-13.png
        :alt: Image showing Adjustment of cutting wheel





3) Mounting the cutter on the pipe
----------------------------------

    Open the cutter by turning the feed handle counter clockwise direction and place the cutter on the pipe with great care so that the rollers are in contact with the pipe. Then, turn the screw handle clockwise until the cutter wheel contacts the pipe.

    .. figure:: images/2-14.png
        :alt: Image showing Mounting the cutter on the pipe



4) True Tracking
----------------
    After cutter wheel is in contact with the pipe, slowly turn the feed screw ¼ of a turn and rotate the cutter through 360° so that the wheel cuts a light groove. Check this groove if it “tracks” into the original starting groove. If it does, the result will be a good cut else it will not cut. If the cutter does not track, the cutter wheel might be damaged and should be replaced.

    .. figure:: images/2-15.png
        :alt: Image showing  True Tracking



5) The cut
----------
    Having ensure a “true track”, tight the feed screw turning a quarter and rotate the cutter around the pipe progressively tightening the screw at each turn until the pipe is cut. Do not force the cutter wheel into the pipe which may result in damage and shortening the life of the cutter wheel.

    .. figure:: images/2-16.png
        :alt: Image showing the cut using pipe cut


Following are the steps for proper maintenance of pipe cutters:
    
    |   a) Always clean the tools correctly after each jobs using cleaning agent and wire brush to clean the feed screw, rollers and cutter wheel.
    |
    |   b) Always ensure that the feed screw, slide, rollers and cutter wheels are well lubricated using suitable lubricating oil.
    |
    |   c) Inspect the all the components of pipe cutters frequently and examine for proper tracking and cutter wheel sharpness.
    |
    |   d) Always store correctly. For example, hang cutter in a warm dry area.

Try square, Vernier caliper joining elements: - Nuts, bolts, washer, pins, screws and rivets and jute/pipe tape and lead
========================================================================================================================

Try square
----------

    Try square is a woodworking or a metalworking tool for marking and measuring workpiece. Its primary work is to measure the right angle (90 degrees) of corners accurately. And to try a surface means to check its straightness or correspondence relative to an adjoining surface. It is found in size 15 cm, 20 cm, 30 cm etc. We should avoid oily surfaces while measuring with try square.

Vernier caliper
---------------

    Vernier caliper is an instrument that measures internal or external dimensions and distances. It helps in making more precise measurements than other regular rulers. Before measuring, close the jaws and faces to zero out the reading so that we get a precise measurement otherwise you will have to correct for the zero error. For measuring any length, compare the 0 line of the Vernier scale with the main scale. Then check the division that coincides with the graduated or main scale and add the first reading with the third reading by multiplying.
    
    A scale cannot measure objects which are smaller than 1mm, but a Vernier caliper can measure up to 1mm.
